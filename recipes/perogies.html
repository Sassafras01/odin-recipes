    <h3>My grandfather is Polish, and his mother taught my grandmother how to make these delicious perogies.</h3>

        <p>The recipe has been in the family for generations, with a few alterations of course!</p>

        <p>Serve plain, or with butter, sour cream, bacon, etc. Perfecting the perogie technique takes time, and after 
            a while, you will develop your own system.</p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 large red-skinned potatoes (not baking potatoes), peeled and halved</li>
                    <li>4 - 6 oz (115 to 170 g) medium cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>1 medium onion, diced, sautéed in butter</li>
                    <li>salt and white pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>

             <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil potatoes as you would for mashed potatoes. Drain.</li>
                    <li>While potatoes are hot, stir in cheddar. Cover until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Stir in sautéed onion; using potato masher, mash until smooth. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Using clean cloth, squeeze out all moisture from cottage cheese. Stir into potato mixture. 
                        Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                </ol>
