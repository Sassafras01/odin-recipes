    <h3>This big Italian salad is my go-to for spaghetti and meatballs, 
        fettucini bolognese, pasta e fagioli, baked ziti, focaccia or anything 
        else in that Italian comfort food realm.</h3>

        <p>The homemade dressing is what makes it so good: think of it as a much, 
            much improved version of that bottled Italian dressing sitting in your fridge door.</p>

        <p>The dressing takes just a few minutes to make — and, if you’re used to the beige bottled stuff, 
            you’ll be surprised to see how fresh herbs make this vinaigrette a beautiful and vibrant green. 
            That’s how it should be!</p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 large head romaine lettuce</li>
                    <li>1 large red bell pepper, chopped</li>
                    <li>1 cup seeded and chopped hothouse cucumbers</li>
                    <li>1 to 2 carrots, peeled into ribbons</li>
                </ul>

             <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the dressing: Combine all dressing ingredients in a food processor and blitz to blend.</li>
                    <li>Place all of the salad ingredients except for the cheese in a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add more dressing little by little as necessary; be sure to dress greens very generously, otherwise 
                        salad will be bland.</li>
                    <li>Toss in the cheese, then taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary..</li>
                </ol>
