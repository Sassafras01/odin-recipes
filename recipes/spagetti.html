    <h3>This recipe has been handed down from my mother. It is a family favorite and will not be replaced! 
        (Definite husband pleaser!)</h3>

        <p>For this spaghetti, we turn to our favorite quick meat sauce recipe. Itâ€™s made using one-pot, is ultra flavorful, 
            and can be made in under 45 minutes.</p>

        <p>The spaghetti sauce is also perfect for making ahead. It can be refrigerated for up to three days and stored in your 
            freezer for about three months.</p>
